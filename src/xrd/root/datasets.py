"""The datasets machine learning is taught with, written as ROOT files.

    >>> from xrd.root import datasets                        # doctest: +SKIP

    {'train_airplane': 5000, 'train_automobile': 5000, ...}

Physics keeps its data in ROOT and reads it over XRootD; everyone else keeps
theirs in whatever the framework of the year unpacks. That is a shame in one
direction only - the format is perfectly good at images and tables - so this
module converts the sets people actually teach and benchmark with into ROOT
files, laid out the way a training loop wants them: one tree per class, a
fixed-size array per entry, the label beside it, and the row's place in the
original file so any number can be traced back to where it came from.

Nothing is redistributed here. Each dataset is fetched from the people who
publish it, on the machine doing the converting, and :attr:`DATASETS` records
what each one is and what its licence says. The converted file carries that
same statement in an ``about`` key, so a file that outlives this program still
says where it came from.

Every archive is read with the standard library and nothing else - IDX, tar,
zip, gzip and CSV. The CIFAR sets are taken in their binary distribution
rather than the Python one on purpose: that one is a pickle, and unpickling a
download is a way to run somebody else's code.
